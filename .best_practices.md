# Root README

There are plenty of README's in this structure. They mostly outline best practices, use-cases, and general advice. This is a high-level and root-dir view.

## ansible.cfg

Typically you should at _least_ set `hostfile` and `roles_path`. The second is self-explanitory, but common sense says to set `hostfile` to `./inventories/dev` so as to have ansible default to running on `dev` instead of `prod` unless explicitly specified. We're _all_ about making this idiot-proof.

### Tags

Make sure most if not all in your playbook use tags. Typically though, they can either be separated by the tags at the role level, or by hosts, as playbooks are separated by hosts anyways.


----------------------------------------------------------------------- EXTERNAL BEST-PRACTICES ADVICE 
#Ansible Best Practises

If infrastructures are to be treated as a code than projects that manage them must be treated as software projects. As your infrastructure code gets bigger and bigger you have more problems to deal with it. Code layout, variable precedence, small hacks here and there. Therefore, organization of your code is very important, and in this repository you can find some of the best practices (in our opinion) to manage your infrastructure code. Problems that are addressed are:

* Overall organization
* How to manage external roles
* Usage of variables
* Naming
* Staging
* Complexity of plays
* Encryption of data (e.g. passwords, certificates)
* Installation of ansible and module dependencies


##TL;DR
* Do not manage external roles in your repository manually, use ansible-galaxy
* Do not use pre_task, task or post_tasks in your play, use roles to reuse the code
* Keep all your variables in one place, if possible
* Do not use variables in your play
* Use variables in the roles instead of hard-coding
* Keep the names consistent between groups, plays, variables, and roles
* Different environments (development, test, production) must be close as possible, if not equal
* Do not put your password or certificates as plain text in your git repo, use ansible-vault for encrypting
* Use tags in your play
* Keep all your ansible dependencies in a single place and make the installation dead-simple


##1. Directory Layout
This is the directory layout of this repository with explanation.


    production.ini            # inventory file for production stage
    development.ini           # inventory file for development stage
    test.ini                  # inventory file for test stage
    vpass                     # ansible-vault password file
                              # This file should not be committed into the repository
                              # therefore file is in ignored by git
    group_vars/
        all/                  # variables under this directory belongs all the groups
            apt.yml           # ansible-apt role variable file for all groups
        webservers/           # here we assign variables to webservers groups
            apt.yml           # Each file will correspond to a role i.e. apt.yml
            nginx.yml         # ""
        postgresql/           # here we assign variables to postgresql groups
            postgresql.yml    # Each file will correspond to a role i.e. postgresql
            postgresql-password.yml   # Encrypted password file
    plays/
        ansible.cfg           # Ansible.cfg file that holds all ansible config
        webservers.yml        # playbook for webserver tier
        postgresql.yml        # playbook for postgresql tier

    roles/
        roles_requirements.yml# All the information about the roles
        external              # All the roles that are in git or ansible galaxy
                              # Roles that are in roles_requirements.yml file will be downloaded into this directory
        internal              # All the roles that are not public

    extension/
        setup                 # All the setup files for updating roles and ansible dependencies


##2. How to Manage Roles
It is a bad habit to manage the roles that are developed by other developers, in your git repository manually. It is also important to separate them so that you can distinguish those that are external and can be updated vs those that are internal. Therefore, you can use ansible-galaxy for installing the roles you need, at the location you need, by simply defining them in the roles_requirements.yml:

```
- src: ANXS.build-essential
  version: "v1.0.1"
```

Roles can be downloaded/updated with this command:

```
./extensions/setup/role_update.sh
```
This command will delete all external roles and download everything from scratch. It is a good practice, as this will not allow you to make changes in the roles.


##3. Keep your plays simple
If you want to take the advantage of the roles, you have to keep your plays simple.
Therefore do not add any tasks in your main play. Your play should only consist of the list of roles that it depends on. Here is an example:

```

- name: postgresql.yml | All roles
  hosts: postgresql
  sudo: True

  roles:
    - { role: common,                   tags: ["common"] }
    - { role: ANXS.postgresql,          tags: ["postgresql"] }
```

As you can see there are also no variables in this play, you can use variables in many different ways in ansible, and to keep it simple and easier to maintain do not use variables in plays. Furthermore, use tags, they give wonderful control over role execution.



##4. Stages
Most likely you will need different stages (e.g. test, development, production) for the product you are either developing or helping to develop. A good way to manage different stages is to have multiple inventory files. As you can see in this repository, there are three inventory files. Each stage you have must be identical as possible, that also means, you should try to use few as possible host variables. It is best to not use at all.


##5. Variables
Variables are wonderful, that allows you to use all this existing code by just setting some values. Ansible offers many different ways to use variables. However, soon as your project starts to get bigger, and more you spread variables here and there, more problems you will encounter. Therefore it is good practice to keep all your variables in one place, and this place happen to be group_vars. They are not host dependent, so it will help you to have a better staging environment as well. Furthermore, if you have internal roles that you have developed, keep the variables out of them as well, so you can reuse them easily.


##6. Name consistency
If you want to maintain your code, keep the name consistency between your plays, inventories, roles and group variables. Use the name of the roles to separate different variables in each group. For instance, if you are using the role nginx under webservers play, variables that belong to nginx should be located under *group_vars/webservers/nginx.yml*. What this effectively means is that  group_vars supports directory and every file inside the group will be loaded. You can, of course, put all of them in a single file as well, but this is messy, therefore don't do it.


##7. Encrypting Passwords and Certificates
It is most likely that you will have a password or certificates in your repository. It is not a good practise to put them in a repository as plain text. You can use [ansible-vault](http://docs.ansible.com/playbooks_vault.html) to encrypt sensitive data. You can refer to [postgresql-password.yml](https://github.com/enginyoyen/ansible-best-practises/blob/master/group_vars/postgresql/postgresql-password.yml) in group variables to see the encrypted file and [postgresql-password-plain.yml](https://github.com/enginyoyen/ansible-best-practises/blob/master/group_vars/postgresql/postgresql-password-plain.yml) to see the plain text file, commented out.
To decrypt the file, you need the vault password, which you can place in your root directory but it MUST NOT be committed to your git repository. You should share the password with you coworkers with some other method than committing to git a repo.

There is also [git-crypt](https://github.com/AGWA/git-crypt) that allow you to work with a key or GPG. Its more transparent on daily work than `ansible-vault`


##8. Project Setup
As it should be very easy to set-up the work environment, all required packages that ansible needs, as well as ansible should be installed very easily. This will allow newcomers or developers to start using ansible project very fast and easy. Therefore, python_requirements.txt file is located at:

```
extensions/setup/python_requirements.txt
```

This structure will help you to keep your dependencies in a single place, as well as making it easier to install everything including ansible. All you have to do is to execute the setup file:

```
./extensions/setup/setup.sh
```


#Running the Code
Code in this repo is functional and test it. To run it, you need to install ansible and all the dependencies. You can do this simply by executing:

```
./extensions/setup/setup.sh
```

* If you already have ansible, and you do not want to go through the installation simply create a vpass text file in the root directory and add the secret code (123456)
* To install roles execure the role_update.sh which will download all the roles
```
./extensions/setup/role_update.sh
```
* Go to plays directory and the execute and do not forget to change the host address in the development.ini
```
ansible-playbook -i ../development.ini webservers.yml
```

# Inventories

For _my_ purposes anyways, there are only dev and prod. Since I'm not necessarily _developing_ applications and just _deploying_ them, I think it's pretty easy to see that I only need the two. I also shouldn't have to spell out the differences.

I did want to take a moment to touch on hosts and group_vars, so without further ado, as brevity is the soul of wit:

## Hosts

The `hosts` file should have hosts grouped by the purpose of the host (roles) and also geography or datacenter location (if applicable). Like is mentioned in the 'Best Practices':

> We’re somewhat repeating ourselves with this tip, but it’s worth repeating. A system can be in multiple groups. See Inventory and Patterns. Having groups named after things like webservers and dbservers is repeated in the examples because it’s a very powerful concept.
>
> This allows playbooks to target machines based on role, as well as to assign role specific variables using the group variable system.

#### NOTE:

In the future, I _may_ deviate from that as a per-application basis and start rolling up per-subnet or even per-network playbooks with backups, load balancers, dual webhosts with two applications but each has a different hostname/application on them etc. Either way, right now I'm just getting the hang of it one at a time.

I _also_ am excited to apply this to network configuration management as well.

## Group_Vars

The `group_vars` directory will have most of the variables in it one way or another. It may (later on as specified above) be advantageous to maintain multiple files under that directory, but for the time being, being able to locate any given variable inside of `group_vars/all` makes maintaining this code easier.

For sensitive variables - like passwords, keys, etc - a file of `group_vars/all_encrypted` can be created using the `../.vpass` file for encryption and decryption.

Keep in mind that variables defined in those files will override any distinction made in any particular role's `vars/` or `defaults/` directory/file. Variables defined here are only overridden by playbooks (group.yml or site.yml) or upon CLI invocation.



----------------------

# site.yml and the plays/ directory

During the time I was developing the playbook that was directing my mailserver rollout, I came across a few architectural glitches, as well as a few shortcuts. I have found that the easiest way to think of a playbook is that it does _nothing_ except contribute to the layers of indirection.

For one, there should _never_ be any internal plays, as they are all almost always re-usable, and should therefore be put in a role, as it would be more modular that way.

Secondly, site.yml can itself contain plays. For instance:

```
- name: Tasks segregated at the role level
  hosts: all
  remote_user: root

  roles:
  - common
  - iptables
  - postfix-server
  - mysql
```

This was for my mailserver. __Before__ I included any other playbooks, I set up the roles that were in common for _all_ of the hosts, and it worked! For instance, they might all have different iptables configurations, but that is dealt with at the variable level, and since they all need to address it during their setup, I might as well have them all run at once.

That's another advantage to this, initially, all of the hosts run at once. If I _only_ did `include`'s that pointed to my plays, and they were for individual or separate groups of hosts, they each run iptables on their first go-round. That means that I'd be stuck waiting for iptables task that would take three (in this case with three machines) times as long to complete. This way, I can send it to them in parallel and only spend (iptables * time) amount of time instead of 3 * (iptables * time). If that makes sense. IDK. Trust me on this one. It's waaaay better.

Next, the `plays/` directory can be populated with plays that define roles that are only for certain hosts within that playbook.

# Hosts naming

This one's easy. Simple and Singular. It's a descriptor of each individual server. And one word typically suffices.
